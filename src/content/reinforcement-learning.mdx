# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to achieve a goal. Here are some basics:

- **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker.
- **Environment**: The space in which the agent operates.
- **Reward**: Feedback received by the agent after performing an action.

Reinforcement Learning is commonly used in robotics, game development, and autonomous systems.
